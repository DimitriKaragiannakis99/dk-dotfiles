# 🌱 Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal **dotfiles**!  
This repository contains the configuration and small automations I use daily to customize my developer environment.  

---

### 📝 Neovim
- Based on [TJ Devries’ *Kickstart Neovim*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o) video.  

### ⚙️ Bin Scripts
- `bin/` contains small executables I wrote to automate repetitive tasks:  
  - 📒 **Notion Automations** → quickly add jobs/tasks to my Notion database.  
  - 🗂️ **Zettelkasten Organizer** → keeps my notes structured automatically.  
  - …plus other helpers that simplify my workflow.  

All scripts in `bin/` are executable and can be called directly once the folder is on your `$PATH`.

### 🐚 Zsh
- `.zshrc` includes my shell customizations:
  - Aliases for frequent commands.  
  - Environment variables for projects/tools.  
  - Plugin & prompt setup for a cleaner workflow.

### Progress Bar
- Made in bash
- Progress bar for the processing of the transfer of files from my zettelkasten folder to their respective note folders
